    "All numpy array is under the class `numpy.ndarray`. Compare to the original List in Python, there isn't much difference between the two except the fact that `numpy.ndarray` has a fixed size after construct. That means both `numpy.array` and `List` can store any thing we assign to it. However, one important thing is that most of the operations in Numpy requires the array to have numerical types. Another problems that might arise with such versitility is that some operations might require specific type of the data. If we don't take extra pre-cautions to the data types of the array, it could cause catastrophic results. (Imagine you have trained a model for 2 days only to find that the data type is wrong and the result is garbbage.)\n"
